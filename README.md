- 👋 Hi, I’m @McBurly
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web development as a path to working abroad, and to help facilitate some ttrpg projects my friends and I have been talking about for years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic web development content using The Odin Project, I haven't begun the actual coding and languages aspects yet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! In any area I've worked in from my first job at Wendy's to material science/engineering I've always found working together to be the best way to increases skills and gain new insights.
- 📫 How to reach me via email at matthew.hunton@gmail.com
